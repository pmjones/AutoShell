_AutoShell_ automatically maps CLI command names to PHP command classes in a
 specified namespace, reflecting on a specified main method within that class
 to determine the argument and option values. The method parameters may be
 scalar values(int, float, string, bool) or arrays.

_AutoShell_ has no dependencies and is low-maintenance. Merely adding a class
to your source code, in the recognized namespace and with the recognized
main method name, automatically makes it available as a command.

Think of _AutoShell_ as the "router" for your CLI command classes:

-  Under ADR or MVC, you have a Front Controller pass the URL to a Router,
   and get back a Route object describing which Action/Controller to invoke
   (with the arguments thereto). The Front Controller would then invoke the
   Action/Controller with those arguments.

-  Here, you have a Console class pass `$_SERVER['argv']` to a Shell, and
   get back an Exec object describing which Command class to invoke (with the
   options and arguments thereto). The Console would then invoke the Command
   with those options and arguments.

That is:

    Front Controller    => Console
    Router              => Shell
    Route               => Exec
    Action/Controller   => Command

### Installation

Install _AutoShell_ using Composer:

```
composer require pmjones/auto-shell
```

### Console Script

You will need a console script to run your commands. To create a console
script, open a file in your project at `bin/console.php` and add the
following code:

```php
<?php
use AutoShell\Console;

require dirname(__DIR__) . '/vendor/autoload.php';

$console = Console::new(
    namespace: 'Project\Cli\Command',
    directory: dirname(__DIR__) . '/src/Cli/Command',
    help: 'The console for my Project.' . PHP_EOL . PHP_EOL,
);

$code = $console($_SERVER['argv']);
exit($code);
```

You will need to specify the `namespace` for your command classes, and the
`directory` where those class files are saved. You can also specify `help`
text to be shown at the top of all help output, but doing so is optional.

Now you can issue `php bin/console.php` and see some output:

```
The console for my Project.

No commands found.
Namespace: Project\Cli\Command\
Directory: /path/to/project/src/Cli/Command
```

This output is to be expected, since there are no commands yet.

### Command Class

Open a file at `src/Project/Cli/Command/Hello.php` and add the following code:

```php
<?php
namespace Project\Cli\Command;

class Hello
{
    public function __invoke(string $name) : int
    {
        echo "Hello {$name}" . PHP_EOL;
        return 0;
    }
}
```

That's all -- the command should now be available via the console script. If you issue the following ...

    php bin/console.php hello world

... you should see `Hello world` as the output.

> Note:
>
> This example uses `echo` to generate output, but you can use
> any other output mechanism you like.

### Adding Options

To enable options on the command, create a class that implements the _Options_
marker interface, using `#[Option]` attributes on constructor-promoted
properties. Then add that _Options_ implementation to the main method
parameters to make those options available to the command logic.

First, open a file at `src/Project/Cli/Command/HelloOptions.php` and add the
following code:

```php
<?php
namespace Project\Cli\Command\HelloOptions;

use AutoShell\Option;
use AutoShell\Options;

class HelloOptions implements Options
{
    public function __construct(

        #[Option('u,upper')]
        public readonly ?bool $useUpperCase

    ) {
    }
}
```

Then in the command, add a typehinted main method parameter for the options,
along with some logic for the option behavior:

```php
<?php
namespace Project\Cli\Command;

class Hello
{
    public function __invoke(
        HelloOptions $options,
        string $name
    ) : int
    {
        if ($options->useUpperCase) {
            $name = strtoupper($name);
        }

        echo "Hello {$name}" . PHP_EOL;
        return 0;
    }
}
```

Now if you issue one of the following ...

    php bin/console.php hello world -u
    php bin/console.php hello world --upper

... you will see `Hello WORLD` as the output.

### Giving Help

To add help for your command, use the `#[Help]` attribute.

Edit the command to add `#[Help]` attributes on the class and its main method
parameters:

```php
<?php
namespace Project\Cli\Command;

use AutoShell\Help;

#[Help("Says hello to a _name_ of your choice.")]
class Hello
{
    public function __invoke(
        HelloOptions $options,

        #[Help("The _name_ to say hello to.")]
        string $name
    ) : int
    {
        if ($options->useUpperCase) {
            $name = strtoupper($name);
        }

        echo "Hello {$name}" . PHP_EOL;
        return 0;
    }
}
```

Likewise, edit each `#[Option]` attribute to add a `help` parameter:

```php
<?php
namespace Project\Cli\Command\HelloOptions;

use AutoShell\Option;
use AutoShell\Options;

class HelloOptions implements Options
{
    public function __construct(

        #[Option('u,upper', help: "Output the _name_ in upper case.")]
        public readonly ?bool $useUpperCase

    ) {
    }
}
```

Now when you issue `php bin/console.php` or `php bin/console.php help`,
you should see your command listed in the roster of commands:

```
The console for my Project.

hello
    Says hello to a name of your choice.
```

Similarly, when you issue `php bin/console.php help hello`, you should
see a manual page for your command:

```
The console for my Project.

NAME
    hello

SYNOPSIS
    hello [options] [--] name ...

ARGUMENTS
    name
         The name to say hello to.

OPTIONS
    -u
    --upper
        Output the name in upper case.
```

## Advanced Topics

### Command Naming

Command class files are presumed to be named according to PSR-4 standards;
further:

- Dash-separated words are converted to CamelCase

- Colons indicate a namespace separator

For example, given a base namespace of `Project\Cli\Command`, the command name
`create-article` maps to the class `Project\Cli\Command\CreateArticle`.

Likewise, the command name `schema:dump` maps to the class
`Project\Cli\Command\Schema\Dump`.

The _Shell_ will parse the command name to find the correct class, then
reflect on the "main" method in that class (typically `__invoke()`) to find
the available options and arguments, and parse those out as well.
(The _Shell_ ignores interfaces, traits, abstract classes, and _Options_
implementations.)

If you want to name your command classes with a suffix, specify that suffix
when creating the _Console_ object:

```php
$console = Console::new(
    namespace: 'Project\Cli\Command',
    directory: dirname(__DIR__) . '/src/Cli/Command',
    suffix: 'Command'
);
```

### Command Method

By default, _AutoShell_ reflects on `__invoke()` as the main method on command
classes. You can change that main method when creating the _Console_. For
example, to use `exec()` as the main method on commands:

```php
$console = Console::new(
    namespace: 'Project\Cli\Command',
    directory: dirname(__DIR__) . '/src/Cli/Command',
    method: 'exec'
);
```

Finally, your main method signature should indicate an `int` return for
the _Console_ exit code. Retuning `0` indicates success, whereas any other
integer value indicates failure or error. See
<http://www.unix.com/man-page/freebsd/3/sysexits/> for common exit codes.

### Command Factory

By default, the _Console_ will just create command classes using `new`. This
is fine for getting started, but you will likely need some form of dependency
injection for your command classes. You can achieve this by setting a command
factory on the _Console_.

To set a factory for creating command objects based on their class name,
perhaps one based on [psr/container][], pass a `$factory` callable to
the _Console_:

```php
/** @var Psr\Container\ContainerInterface $container */

$console = Console::new(
    namespace: 'Project\Cli\Command',
    directory: dirname(__DIR__) . '/src/Cli/Command',
    factory: fn (string $class) => $container->get($class),
);
```

The _Console_ will not use the injected factory for its own help classes; it
will create those itself.

### Argument Types

_AutoShell_ recognizes main method parameter typehints of `int`, `float`,
`string`, `bool`, `mixed`, and `array`, and will automatically cast
values collected from the command-line invocation to their respective
types.

For `bool`, _AutoShell_ will case-insensitively cast these argument values
to `true`: `1, t, true, y, yes`. Similarly, it will case-insensitively cast
these argument values to `false`: `0, f, false, n, no`.

For `array`, _AutoShell_ will use `str_getcsv()` on the argument value to
generate an array. E.g., an array typehint for an argument value of `a,b,c`
will receive `['a', 'b', 'c']`.

Finally, trailing variadic parameters are also honored by _AutoShell_.

### Option Definitions

You can define long and short options for your command by adding an
`#[Option]` attribute to a constructor-promoted property in a class
that implements the _Options_ marker interface.

The property name can be anything you like, but **must be nullable**.
(_AutoShell_ indicates an option was not passed at the command line by
setting it to `null`).

As a matter of good practice, the property should be defined as `readonly`,
and should not have a default value, but these are not strictly necessary.

The first parameter for each `#[Option]` is a comma-separated list
of short and long names for the option, and is required:

```php
<?php
namespace Project\Cli\Command;

use AutoShell\Option;
use AutoShell\Options;

class FooOptions implements Options
{
    public function __construct(

        #[Option('b,bar')]
        public readonly ?bool $barval,

    ) {
    }
}
```

There are several optional named parameters for each `#[Option]` attribute:

- `mode`: (string) Must be one of `Option::VALUE_REJECTED`,
  `VALUE_REQUIRED`, or `VALUE_OPTIONAL`. Default is `VALUE_REJECTED`.

    - If `VALUE_REJECTED`, the option *must not* be specified with a value;
      when the option is specified, its value is always the default
      (see below).
    - If `VALUE_REQUIRED`, the option *must* be specified with a value;
    - If `VALUE_OPTIONAL`, the option *may* be specified with a value; if the
      option is specified without a value, its value is the default
      (see below).

- `default`: (mixed) The value when the option is specified without a value.
  Default is `true`.

- `multiple`: (bool) When `true`, the option may be specified multiple times,
  and the values will be passed as an array.(**Special note:** if the `mode`
  is `VALUE_REJECTED` and the property type is `int`, the value will be an
  integer count of how many times the option was specified.)  Default is
  `false`.

- `help`: (string) A short line of help text about this option for the manual
  page.

Values will be cast to the property type of the `#[Option]`.

Inside your command, you can address the option via an _Options_ parameter
on the main method:

```php
<?php
namespace Project\Cli\Command;

class Foo
{
    public function __invoke(FooOptions $options) : int
    {
        if ($options->barval) {
            // $barval is true
        }

        return 0;
    }
}
```

### Composing Options

Sometimes you will want to have a common set of _Options_ used across all
your commands, along with a set of _Options_ specific to an individual
command. To support this, _AutoShell_ allows more than one _Options_
parameter on the main method:

```php
<?php
namespace Project\Cli\Command;

class Foo
{
    public function __invoke(
        CommonOptions $commonOptions,
        FooOptions $fooOptions
    ) : int
    {
        if ($commonOptions->verbose) {
            // increased verbosity
        }

        if ($fooOptions->bar) {
            // do whatever 'bar' means
        }

        return 0;
    }
}
```

The only caveat to this is that _Options_ specified *later* in the parameters
may not have an option name defined in any *earlier* _Options_ parameter.

Given the above example, this means you cannot define (e.g.) `-f` in **both**
the _CommonOptions_ **and** the _FooOptions_; you must define it on only one
of them. If you define it in more than one, _AutoShell_ will raise an
_OptionAlreadyDefined_ exception.

### Extended Help

You can add extra, long-form text to the command-level _Help_ as a second
parameter. A very light markup of `*bold*` and `_underline_` is supported.

```php
<?php
namespace Project\Cli\Command;

use AutoShell\Help;

#[Help(
    'This command does something.',
    <<<HELP
    *DESCRIPTION*

    This is a longer description of the command.

    *EXAMPLES*

    Look for examples _elsewhere_.

    HELP
)]
class Foo
{
    // ...
}
```

### Console Input/Output

By default, the _Console_ writes help output to `STDOUT`, and writes
invocation-time error messages to `STDERR` (such as when it cannot parse
command line input).

To change where the _Console_ writes output, pass a callable for the `$stdout`
and/or `$stderr` arguments:

```php

/** @var Psr\Container\ContainerInterface $container */
$logger = $container->get(LoggerInterface::class);

$console = Console::new(
    namespace: 'Project\Cli\Command',
    directory: dirname(__DIR__) . '/src/Cli/Command',
    stdout: fn (string $output) => $logger->info($output),
    stderr: fn (string $output) => $logger->error($output),
);
```

Please note that these callables are used **only by the _Console_ itself**
-- and even then, only for help and error output.

### Command Input/Output

_AutoShell_ does not require or provide any command I/O mechanisms. This means
your command classes can use any I/O system you like; it is completely under
your own control.

When getting started, you may wish to just use `echo`, `printf()`, and the
like. However, that may become troublesome, especially when you want to
begin automated testing. You will need to buffer all command output, capture
it, and then read it to assert output correctness.

As an alternative, you can pass a `psr/log` implementation that writes to
STDOUT and STDERR resource handles, such as [pmjones/stdlog][]. Then in
testing, you can instantiate the implementation with `php://memory` resource
handles, and `fread()` the command output from memory.

Finally, you may wish to inject a more powerful standalone CLI input/output
system. I am told [league/climate][] is nice, but have not used it.
